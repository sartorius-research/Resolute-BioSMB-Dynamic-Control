# Resolute-BioSMB-Dynamic-Control
Application of dynamic control features for the Resolute BioSMB using a low-code platform 

# Abstract:
Integrated continuous biomanufacturing (ICB) has been gaining traction as a cost-effective and efficient method for the production of biopharmaceuticals. Adaptive control functions are a key enabler to synchronize between different unit operations and often involve the interfacing of multiple third-party equipment with the actual bioprocessing system. This application note presents a low-code platform that facilitates the seamless integration of external equipment with the Resolute BioSMB chromatography system, enabling advanced control of ICB setups. 

The approach demonstrated here uses the inbuild dynamic control functions of the Resolute BioSMB, which relies on sensor signals from third-party devices, to automate and optimize the chromatography unit operation. As no SCADA software environment is required, this open-source approach provides a more user-friendly and cost-effective automation solution. 

The application note will detail the technical methodology behind the low-code platform and provide a step-by-step guide for interfacing sensor equipment with the Resolute BioSMB.
